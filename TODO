  * RubyCocoa GUI

= DONE

    highlighting (removed March 14 2008 by al3x, may add back in)
  * next/previous commit links on pages
  * pretty stylesheet

= PROBABLY NOT
  * Shoes GUI: Shoes is still pretty immature, ex: all paths are relative
    to the `shoes` binary making requires a pain, etc.
